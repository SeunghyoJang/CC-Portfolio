      <p>
        What I wanted to express through an experimental clock is the psychological 
        pressure on me over time. I feel a lot of pressure about homework. 
        It is often delayed due to the burden of doing well and the psychological pressure
        of the pressure. However, as time goes by, the burden on me increases. 
        Seconds accumulate to become minutes, and minutes accumulate to become an hour.
        As time goes by, the color of my face turns redder is an expression of 
        my psychological burden.

        Reflection & Process
      </h1>

      <p>
What I feel every week while coding as a beginner is that it is difficult to execute
 as it was planned and sketched. The result always appears different from what I 
sketched before and there is always a variable errors in the process. My first plan
        was to divide the canvas into three parts, seconds, minutes, and time. 
        The faces were gradually piling up in each section. After 60 seconds pass, 
        1 face comes down from minute section, and when 60 minutes were piled up, 
        1 face from hour section has to came down. Different proportions of face 
        sizes were applied to each, causing the face to come down in the order of 
        the hour, minutes and seconds. However, the size of the circle suitable for 
        each section could not be applied, so first, all the same face sizes were 
        applied to all seconds, minutes, and time. (With the addition of milliseconds,
        the sections are divided into quarters.) Instead of stacking 60 seconds and 
        then 1 minute coming down, each section was filled with 100 circles with x:5, 
        y:20. The method of filling the color is now.get Milliseconds(), now.get 
        Seconds(), now.getMinutes(), and now.get Hours(), which are applied by coloring
        the face based on the current time. The change in face color as the unit of time 
        increases was applied to each section. I want to figure it a little more about the
        how to apply different facial expressions and the change in the size of the circle
        for each time unit.
