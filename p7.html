      <p>
        In this assignment, I wanted to reflect my recent life with games. Since I came to graduate school, I have so many things to do that I am always tired. Even though I'm tired, but I have to finish what I have to do, so I try to concentrate and stay awake somehow. Coffee and alarm clocks are the driving forces that keep me awake. I can't stay without coffee for a day, and there are about five alarm clocks set almost every two minutes before morning classes. Sometimes team projects, meetings, etc. are all set beyond my memory that I can't remember. There is a burden and passion to do everything well, but sometimes I want to give up and sleep. Sleep is a great temptation for me. The reason I want to sleep is, of course, because I'm tired, but I can escape from the real world. This is because I don't have to think about anything such as school, homework, etc. while sleeping. When I'm too stressed, I jump on the bed and sleep. Because I fall asleep so easily, it is heaven after I just get in the bed. The problem is that there are many cases where I don't finish my work and just sleep to escape. Sleeping is essential for humans, but sleeping without completing all the work makes me feel guilty. The purpose of this game is to choose my mindset according to my work first (busy, tired, ambitious) and then finish my work by taking task, coffee, and alarm to avoid the temptation of sleep. Choosing seducing temptation(sleep) doubles coffee, alarms, and tasks. The final goal of this game is to finish what to do and rest to avoid temptation as much as possible.

      <p>
Making a game is not easy. Since Iâ€™m not a game person, it was difficult to construct a storyboard. This is because games must have a purpose that I have to achieve, and there are obstacles that hinder me from achieving the purpose. However, through this task, I think I have learned how to construct a certain degree of game direction. It was also interesting to intervene my story in the game, not just a random story. I divided the scene into three categories and divided it into 1.choosing player / 2.game scene / 3.Pause & replay, and it seems that connecting these three scenes naturally was also a big challenge for me. Overall, I think it was a good opportunity for me to experience the composition of the game and the storyboard.
