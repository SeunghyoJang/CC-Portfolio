        My new story
      </h1>

      <p>
        After reading Jenny's story, I felt that the function of the robot she drew and the peace my dog gave me were similar. If I had a robot that felt the same as my dog gave me, I would live right away without hesitation. Especially the phrase “He will always stick by your side like a best friend.” There was also a similar feeling when I saw the Sphinx drawn by Yuyuan. Mainly in Egypt, there are many statues of sphinx represent that it protecting people. When I combine Jenny, Yuyuan and with my drawing, I feel like I made a figure that gives me such a happy feeling and inner peace.

      <b>Jenny's Story/</b><br> This is RB57, an AI from 2057, and he is designed to brighten up your day. He will bring you ice cream on a warm day and a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly night. Feeling sad? He will give you a big hug then tell you a cheesy joke. He will always stick by your side like a best friend.

      <b>Yuyuan's Story/</b><br> This is a "Sphinx cat," which is just excavated from an ancient Egyptian pyramid. It is now being exhibited in The MET. Behind it, there is an exhibition wall with some Egyptian tomb mural patterns.

      <b>My Story/</b><br>There is a 16-year-old puppy in Korea living with my family. It is said that since I came to the United States, my dog has heart disease, so she can't even take a walk. Especially when I walk on the street in New York, there are  so many dogs. However, whenever I see them it reminds me of my dog. I also wonder if my dog was a little younger and brought her to New York to take her a walk.

        It was easy to match the ratio by drawing according to the grid that fits the canvas size. This is because it was usually difficult to match the ratio of what I wanted to draw before, so I always repeated the correction. What I felt while using the user define function seems to be collected in a more organized group, especially when drawing different parts. It seems like organizing various crude files into a well-organized folder.

        This task was a little easier than week2 or 3. It was similar to the feeling of doing homework in the first week of using figures. Compared to the first week, I definitely had a better sense of code, but it was still not as easy as drawing with pen or illustrator. The part that was a little challenging in this task was that I had to draw(code) what others drew. Previously, if it didn’t work as I sketched or imagined, I could convert in easier way or change the whole idea. However for this one, I couldn’t be able to change the image. For example, Yuyuan's Sphinx seems to have too many details for me that it was little difficult to code accordingly.
