      <p>
        In Korea, various traditional patterns have been used here and there. It was used in outside the palace where the kings lived and inside the house as an interior elements. Unlike European and American patterns, it usually consists of geometric shapes. But that doesn't mean it's simple. The figures were made by repeating or overlapping very complicatedly. I made it by simplifying the complex traditional patterns of Korea.

I chose the sky blue as a main color that comes to mind when I think of traditional patterns. It is also the color of Goryo-Cheongja(Korea traditional pottery) which has a lot of traditional Korean patterns on it. This color is generatated by chemically reacting with flames when making Goryo-Cheongja. I wanted to make the traditional Korean pattern more in modern way with similar colors.

I wanted to reflect the existing feeling by repeatedly arranging traditional patterns, but I wanted to transform it a little more in modern style. By giving an animation effect, I was able to give a more active feeling to the cultural feeling of Asia, which is always static and quiet. Also it seems that making things that overlap with a little bit of a variety of lines simple played a part.
