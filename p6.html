I take my phone all day from waking up in bed to sleeping at night.
I was quite surprised to see the data on the iPhone setting as a numerical result. I knew that I spent most of the day with my cell phone, but I didn't know I was doing this much interaction through it. As a result of a week of observation, the number of days my cell phone rang the most was 178 times in a day. To analyze the top five, the most frequently notified app was a messenger called Kakao Talk; 123 times and then Gmail 17 times, Instagram 12 times, general messages 11 times, alarm clock 7 times. I wanted to express this homework like a fraction. It is to express the number of times each rang out of the total number of rings. The cell phone rang 178 times a day, and among them, messages, social media, and text messages are expressed the number of times. If I'm pressing the mouse on the Kakao talk message icon, 123 lines will move, and if I press Instagram, 12 lines move. Moving means notification. The small circles at the bottom refer to the total number of rings, such as the denominator.

It was amazing that I was using my cell phone more than I thought while looking at the pattern and amount of my cell phone use.
The idea of expressing my daily life as data visualization is that it is not quite easy to represent figures as visual results. When working on graphics, it is easy to just make them pretty simply, but if you reflect the data, you should have given up on aesthetic things. Also, since I made it, I want to create a data visualization that is easy to understand but easy to read from others' perspectives.
