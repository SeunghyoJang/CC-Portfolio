        Description from Leffin Christopher
      </h1>

      <p>
        A round plastic disc, around 6 cms in diameter. 
They have 8 equidistant small slots in that start along the circumference of the disc and go inward towards the center to about 2mm. One slot was slightly thicker at 4mm.It had an image of squirtle (a pokemon) drawn on it.
      </p>

        Reflection&Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        My partner Leffin first said the shape of the figure and then explained the rest of the details. Leffin wrote the size in numbers on the description, so that I could roughly estimate the proportional size with pixels. When I first drew this image with my code, I first draw a circle within 200px. After that I place eight squares of 10px around the circle. Because eight squares had to be rotated at regular intervals, they were rotated at 4/360=45 degrees each. The shapes cannot be subtracted from the shapes to represent grooves, so the squares and background colors are identical and applied in a batch of no stroke. One of the eight slots was said to be twice as thick as the other, so the width was 20px. The tortoise placing the center is made with circles, arcs, strokes, and retactangle with roundness applied.
