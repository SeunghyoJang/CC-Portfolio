        Since the camera is used, it started with an intro seeking consent before access. It is to give the user the right to choose. Pressing the Enter allows access to the camera, allowing you to use a photo filter, and pressing Q denies access to the camera. According to the Fries model, Freely given: Giving the user a free choice before starting. Reversible: If you change your mind while using it in the middle or don't want to use it, you can always quit by pressing the quit button. Informed: In the initial intro, this camera filter will not be turned on without consent and will not be recorded or used elsewhere. Enthusiastic: Even though people are not interested, they do not necessarily use this camera filter to force themselves to access something.
Specific: Explain in as much detail as possible what seeks consent to allow access to the camera filter.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
Before this project, I didn't know how poorly the fries model was built in the services I use every day. To use the service, I had to press consent, and if I did not agree, I could not move on. In addition, unless the program itself is terminated or I force to end it, it canâ€™t go back. It did not state in detail where and how what I agree is used. It seems that the company abuse it commercially by the chance that people don't know these systems. Unless legally regulated, it is a shortcut for us to be more alert about these things and use our information not to be abused.
